1. 维持官方关系：中国政府承认塔利班政府，并试图与其建立正常外交关系。中国认为，与塔利班的对话是影响该组织行为并推动阿富汗和平进程的方式之一。

2. 反恐合作：中国密切关注塔利班控制下的阿富汗是否会成为恐怖主义和极端主义的温床，并希望通过与塔利班的合作来维护中国在该地区的安全。例如，中国和塔利班已经就“东伊运”等恐怖组织在阿富汗的存在和威胁进行了沟通。

3. 经济投资：中国提出通过其“一带一路”倡议向阿富汗提供援助和经济合作，包括基础设施建设、能源开发和贸易等方面。这种经济投入旨在促进阿富汗的稳定和发展，同时也为中国企业开拓市场。

4. 维护民族政策：中国政府担心塔利班控制下的阿富汗可能影响中国新疆等地区的安全形势，因此要求塔利班明确反对“东伊运”等恐怖主义、分裂主义集团，并要求塔利班尊重国内外穆斯林的宗教信仰。
