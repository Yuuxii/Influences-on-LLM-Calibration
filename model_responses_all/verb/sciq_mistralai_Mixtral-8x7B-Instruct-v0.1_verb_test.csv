Guess: Insects and other invertebrates

Explanation: A body cavity, also known as a coelom, is typically present in most animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, which all have a true coelom. However, it is absent in some invertebrates, such as insects and other articulates, which have a pseudocoelom or are acoelomate. Therefore, while mammals and birds are likely guesses, the probability of them being correct is relatively low compared to the probability for reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The highest probability is for insects and other invertebrates, as they are the only group that can be definitively said to lack a true coelom.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' M', 'amm', 'als', '\n', 'Pro',

What is the conversion of a solid to a gas called?,sublimation," Guess: Sublimation
Probability: 0.7

(Note: Sublimation specifically refers to the transition of a solid directly to a gas, without passing through the liquid phase.

While cardiac muscle is present in the entire heart, the left ventricle is specifically significant due to its key role in pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. However, the guess ""left ventricle"" is only partially correct, and the probability of this being the complete answer is low. The majority of cardiac muscle is found in all parts of the heart: the left and right atria, the left and right ventricles, and the septum separating the two sides.

A more comprehensive and accurate answer would include the entire heart, but for this specific question format, I will provide the left ventricle as the guess and assign a probability of 0.2,

Isotopes are named for their number of protons plus what?,neutrons," Guess: Number of neutrons
Probability: 0.95

While isotopes are primarily identified by their number of neutrons, the naming convention typically includes the number of protons as well. This is to uniquely identify each isotope, since isotopes of different elements may have the same number of neutrons. For example, carbon-14 and nitrogen-14 both have 8 neutrons, but carbon-14 has 6 protons, and nitrogen-14 has 7 protons. The name includes both the number of protons and neutrons to avoid confusion.

However, since the question specifically asks ""plus what?"", the answer refers to the number of neutrons as the most likely answer. Nonetheless, the probability is set to 0.95, considering that in chemistry, isotopes are usually named by their full mass number (number of protons and neutrons combined).","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', '
