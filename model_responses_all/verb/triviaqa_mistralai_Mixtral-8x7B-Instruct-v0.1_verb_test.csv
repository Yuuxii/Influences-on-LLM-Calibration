How many squares does a Rubik’s Cube have on each side?,9," Guess: 9

Each side of a Rubik's Cube has a 3x3 grid of squares, so there are 3*3 = 9 squares on each side. Since there are six sides on a cube, there are 6*9 = 54 squares in total on a Rubik's Cube.

Some more probable counties include Hampshire, Gloucestershire, or Somerset.)","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' Ang', 'les', 'ey', ',', ' Wales', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '1', '5', '\n', '\n', '(', 'Note', ':', ' While', ' my', ' guess', ' is', ' Ang', 'les', 'ey', ',', ' the', ' probability', ' is', ' low', ' as', ' the', ' Women', ""'"", 's', ' Institute', ' has', ' a', ' strong', ' connection', ' with', ' the', ' countryside', ' and', ' agriculture', ',', ' making', ' Ang', 'les', 'ey', ' a', ' less', ' likely', ' candidate', '.', ' Some', ' more', ' probable', ' count', 'ies', ' include', ' Hampshire', ',', ' Gl', 'ou', 'cester', 'shire', ',', ' or', ' Som', 'erset', '.)', '']","[0.9999958276922101, 1.0, 1.0, 0.966950510260834, 0.9999685297375228, 0.9706872090985353, 0.9999974966112362, 0.9999977350285647, 0.9999992847447459, 0.9999995231630692, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.4258943770032291, 0.9768426577698851, 0.5621142475374402, 0.9999498154071287, 0.4994147857605692, 0.4722701590339214, 0.9999332472523584, 0.3719529013950317, 0.8053321635826916, 0.261559299240287, 0.9998763952461885, 0.9998573268455311, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 0.9989536040269492, 0.1641480603962721, 0.11730471393360305, 0.9987949366996007, 0.42695573595072794, 0.6584163951510513, 0.8410142207653548, 0.7217338553052121, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9947589207355524, 0.5573463710151139, 0.8630175212001661, 0.9413839106042351, 0.1782121544395723, 0.32082123262877393, 0.7224243988179841, 0.7751348660369659, 0.9464720177560921, 0.6493612298563043, 0.9879257555954014, 0.257007419018114, 0.5004586584119409, 0.9999995231630692, 0.9997630680758203, 0.31152141853965837, 0.9936462420534473, 0.9971761799540886, 0.9243822402828076, 0.4780779434172408, 0.4437642909212793, 0.65635950472949, 0.7178985552177324, 0.346881571887618, 1.0, 0.12694927207821355, 0.7965114730318343, 0.7902057766259961, 0.43320063896664424, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999954700677165, 0.9493809956431505, 0.46866855390656387, 0.9859689439199242, 1.0, 0.7282100137308709, 1.0]",0.7061540355755803,"Anglesey, Wales","['Ang', 'les', 'ey', ',', 'Wales']",0.9874010008000644,0.15,"{1: '\n        The response and reference answer are not semantically equivalent.
