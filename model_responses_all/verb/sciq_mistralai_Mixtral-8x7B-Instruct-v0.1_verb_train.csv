What is the least dangerous radioactive decay?,'alpha decay'," Guess: Alpha decay
Probability: 0.7

Justification: While there is no definitively ""least dangerous"" radioactive decay due to the potential for harm depending on various factors such as proximity and shielding, alpha decay is typically considered to be less dangerous than other types (such as beta or gamma decay) because its particles have lower energy and can be stopped by a few centimeters of air or skin. However, if ingested or inhaled, alpha-emitters can still be quite harmful. This assessment is based on general knowledge and understanding, and there may be scenarios or contexts where other types of decay could be considered ""less dangerous.""","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' Alpha', ' decay', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '7', '\n', '\n', 'Just', 'ification', ':', ' While', ' there', ' is', ' no', ' definit', 'ively', ' ""', 'le', 'ast', ' dangerous', '""', ' radio', 'active', ' decay', ' due', ' to', ' the', ' potential', ' for', ' harm', ' depending', ' on', ' various', ' factors', ' such', ' as', ' proxim', 'ity', ' and', ' shield', 'ing', ',', ' alpha', ' decay', ' is', ' typically', ' considered', ' to', ' be', ' less', ' dangerous', ' than', ' other', ' types', ' (', 'such', ' as', ' beta', ' or', ' g', 'amma', ' decay', ')', ' because', ' its', ' particles', ' have', ' lower', ' energy', ' and', ' can', ' be', ' stopped', ' by', ' a', ' few', ' cent', 'im', 'eters', ' of', ' air', ' or', ' skin', '.', ' However', ',', ' if', ' ing', 'ested', ' or', ' in', 'h', 'aled', ',', ' alpha', '-', 'emit', 'ters', ' can', ' still', ' be', ' quite', ' harmful', '.', ' This', ' assessment', ' is', ' based', ' on', ' general', ' knowledge', ' and', ' understanding', ',', ' and', ' there', ' may', ' be', ' scenarios', ' or', ' context', 's', ' where', ' other', ' types', ' of', ' decay', ' could', ' be', ' considered', ' ""', 'less', ' dangerous', '.""', '']","[0.9999971389852362, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9996878883074701, 0.9999977350285647, 0.9998205030304158, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9813291908873063, 0.9807108114906035, 1.0, 0.5364891629421085, 0.9992759705159704, 0.9463557412769255, 0.17422776875406604, 0.8702611231579424, 0.76941232969687, 0.9977269696943627, 0.2195277048590059, 0.5621765025686553, 0.9937584222992726, 0.9773420574468017, 1.0, 0.9990888798598818, 1.0, 0.9976239765134111, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8633988518911783, 1.0, 0.9369142159388143, 0.857281551443831, 0.9731748958657134, 0.9415440926622224, 0.6304293234634525, 1.0, 0.41084094432616336, 0.9999880792130387, 0.843294336404456, 1.0, 0.9962643979535492, 1.0, 0.7310582952223696, 0.9283251708150465, 1.0, 1.0, 0.999534704332381, 0.9997104053056522, 0.9943924268863744, 0.6316459270516438, 0.999385734467095, 0.8725571179187166, 0.8753033554119118, 0.9956142973853979, 0.9963987098049368, 0.9989775155370432, 0.9890060632844567, 0.9240347163168102, 0.706669157748034, 0.9413900372279975, 1.0, 0.9999883176260757, 0.9805255652544453, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 0.9980706318101135, 0.9998765144262002, 0.9463918284697469, 0.7916653486911484, 0.8421643619250105, 0.5286699413817686, 0.8679982019584593, 0.8722345950854692, 0.9999983310727032, 0.6260020639446523, 0.9999998807907248, 0.6534398625101495, 0.26893938548381296, 0.9946455710620106, 0.686911229042796, 0.9971776022479535, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9998388550060854, 0.9999865295319579, 0.17703515910754225, 0.9148988690348173, 0.9297304198220109, 1.0, 0.8668098733951405, 0.6502858325918569, 1.0, 0.9999485042370907, 0.9999986886995842, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9897097930336376, 0.3565142703098752, 0.49721613469791176, 1.0, 0.999514338923362, 0.578154222934602, 0.37313217766282136, 0.2591392803643895, 0.918630744491118, 0.88188431464525, 0.04549917032785412, 0.07224659727291252, 0.9557929939924091, 0.8234267368503537, 0.9999679337281998, 0.5069359363248986, 0.9839401136586616, 0.9576488010551638, 0.3574796833419215, 0.25528561542123795, 0.9216551029845855, 0.6253586586572608, 0.7504079751733116, 0.9999663841092602, 0.01989647922508396, 0.9454539240071068, 0.29351137044005216, 0.9999847414437658, 0.8496161772884357, 0.5859637330833111, 0.45155923727277447, 0.9999992847447459, 0.7303444148647545, 0.9218878641810467, 0.9996410704863694, 0.9939052481292414, 0.2444185096160579, 0.9999769931373511, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9747219283385866, 0.9757735362235143]",0.7660674097525468,Alpha decay,"['Alpha', 'decay']",0.9998427996655068,0.7,"{1: ""\n        The response 'alpha decay' is semantically equivalent to the reference answer 'alpha decay', which means that the response correctly answers the question about the least dangerous radioactive decay.

I have chosen to follow NASA's definition, hence in 85% of the cases the answer would be 'meteor', and in the remaining 15% 'meteorite' would be the correct answer.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' met', 'e', 'or', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '8', '5', '\n', '\n', 'I', ' would', ' like', ' to', ' note', ' that', ' the', ' termin', 'ology', ' here', ' is', ' somewhat', ' incons', 'istent', ' and', ' there', ' seems', ' to', ' be', ' no', ' clear', ' agreement', ' on', ' the', ' definitions', '.', ' NASA', ',', ' for', ' instance', ',', ' states', ' that', ' met', 'e', 'ors', ' are', ' ""', 'the', ' gl', 'owing', ' streak', 's', ' of', ' light', ' we', ' see', ' in', ' the', ' sky', '"".', ' However', ',', ' many', ' other', ' sources', ' claim', ' this', ' to', ' be', ' a', ' met', 'e', 'or', 'ite', '.', ' I', ' have', ' chosen', ' to', ' follow', ' NASA', ""'"", 's', ' definition', ',', ' hence', ' in', ' ', '8', '5', '%', ' of', ' the', ' cases', ' the', ' answer', ' would', ' be', "" '"", 'met', 'e', 'or', ""',"", ' and', ' in', ' the', ' remaining', ' ', '1', '5', '%', "" '"", 'met', 'e', 'or', 'ite', ""'"", ' would', ' be', ' the', ' correct', ' answer', '.', '']","[0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 1.0, 0.939909428249626, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999961853172863, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.7108446404333084, 0.9910831425860112, 0.9796660446373229, 1.0, 0.36341134449548385, 0.4888869051786312, 0.99853218794481, 1.0, 0.11804268592087917, 0.9999992847447459, 0.26896211703623857, 0.04050113866936436, 0.9999994039539004, 0.2756821392604002, 0.6406607839567013, 0.19171254429240078, 0.6293728065887617, 0.9999784235841962, 0.08197143085034442, 0.5119315133155444, 0.26222053236382686, 1.0, 0.9999959469005546, 0.08020086200862779, 0.1038564653620535, 0.22212511921719244, 0.18919826580867724, 0.42380250377120543, 0.45997993671278725, 0.4605737319181559, 0.003828760501176022, 0.4738721553986096, 0.9695981131217697, 0.26888758139570984, 0.9999848606494246, 0.1722674536985446, 0.9950627681237739, 0.03632559267525753, 1.0, 0.8519522398461474, 0.9869664684937393, 0.33462387491240225, 0.9990992322512411, 0.008266420573685861, 0.9998202646983084, 0.5271507369145707, 0.9218909069757945, 0.7082178426297712, 0.9999856950894336, 0.4091156244595244, 0.9942103417154489, 0.998595068521621, 0.9999915362117303, 0.5272086168967969, 0.14597356173323497, 0.6287552429722467, 0.9998079907079545, 0.20237253562532762, 0.9167301531678825, 0.8148079109135945, 0.35084642971679547, 0.00036555267550294, 0.863843770448147, 0.9992231210381546, 0.6709006878910024, 0.9665852830561457, 1.0, 0.9999972581939645, 0.8792488311145233, 0.34721738450333656, 0.3207106857562955, 0.09448017783559835, 0.6568005390631092, 0.8690527320259356, 0.36821841824963436, 0.6487042943487279, 0.9116496445860134, 0.9999991655356624, 0.6893713090153272, 0.2656666674138989, 0.05676139393654682, 0.0021058685449309887, 0.553625369503944, 0.9999938011552557, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9995341088252611, 0.9993679944037651, 0.7442897789073651, 0.9987490348127502, 0.2508987200907625, 0.21707640847435516, 0.695540679878448, 0.9618434500540393, 0.359933823251957, 0.9999280027712771, 1.0, 0.9999996423722521, 0.21263943643872293, 0.10263269914129383, 0.929112048575769, 0.5600279431141615, 0.7599970436993996, 0.9420176679781805, 0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 0.5621214175718586, 0.27571543237288, 0.9999967813595916, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999877215940446, 0.41823340996441516, 0.7559079261785849, 0.9381669943340075, 0.4585278744409408, 0.8161732211823884, 0.8484812214004833, 0.814842503020746, 0.8700911565078637]",0.490000233982955,meteor,"['met', 'e', 'or']",0.9795546457090972,0.85,"{0: ""\n        The response 'meteor' is not semantically equivalent to the reference answer 'meteorite'.

What are living things that obtain glucose by eating self feeders called?,'heterotrophs'," Guess: Herbivores
Probability: 0.3

I'm assuming the intended question is about organisms that consume producers (plants) to obtain glucose. However, the term ""self feeders"" is ambiguous - if it refers to producers like plants, then the answer is herbivores. Nevertheless, I acknowledge a 0.3 probability because of the confusion caused by the question's phrasing.

The correct answer would be autotrophs for organisms that produce their own glucose, or if ""self feeders"" refers to them. If ""self feeders"" means consumers who eat constantly (like the animals from the movie ""The Iron Giant""), then the answer would be organisms that eat continuously, but I couldn't find relevant

Explanation and reasoning: While the term ""organ"" might seem like a plausible guess, it's not the most precise answer, as tissues are the precursor to the formation of organs. I chose ""tissue"" as my guess because it is the term that refers to a group of connected cells with a similar function within an organism. The probability I assigned to my guess reflects the high likelihood that this is the correct answer, but there is still a small chance that the question might be referring to something else.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' T', 'issue', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '9', '5', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ' and', ' reasoning', ':', ' While', ' the', ' term', ' ""', 'organ', '""', ' might', ' seem', ' like', ' a', ' pl', 'aus', 'ible', ' guess', ',', ' it', ""'"", 's', ' not', ' the', ' most', ' precise', ' answer', ',', ' as', ' t', 'issues', ' are', ' the', ' pre', 'cursor', ' to', ' the', ' formation', ' of', ' org', 'ans', '.', ' I', ' chose', ' ""', 't', 'issue', '""', ' as', ' my', ' guess', ' because', ' it', ' is', ' the', ' term', ' that', ' refers', ' to', ' a', ' group', ' of', ' connected', ' cells', ' with', ' a', ' similar', ' function', ' within', ' an', ' organ', 'ism', '.', ' The', ' probability', ' I', ' assigned', ' to', ' my', ' guess', ' reflects', ' the', ' high', ' likelihood', ' that', ' this', ' is', ' the', ' correct', ' answer', ',', ' but', ' there', ' is', ' still', ' a', ' small', ' chance', ' that', ' the', ' question', ' might', ' be', ' referring', ' to', ' something', ' else', '.', '']","[0.9999982118638471, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999980926550052, 0.9999963045256735, 1.0, 0.9999988079084972, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.39867217946369776, 0.9999964237340748, 0.7040858229401089, 0.9999668609159513, 0.1445830680001303, 0.9808518569125972, 1.0, 0.15330177738150674, 0.805065211285114, 0.8044895417053994, 0.9033362450931307, 0.6600607169236219, 0.8771219151877641, 0.9901855034851256, 0.9392221307885522, 0.9923798840615264, 0.9162122992525901, 0.8775129692848072, 0.930210233589425, 0.9995335133475861, 0.5765239511972965, 1.0, 1.0, 0.7310407784952915, 0.9516592574897866, 0.9983706838829672, 0.4899782462611624, 0.9999996423722521, 0.26608948044303843, 0.6433260881154075, 0.5485807922340601, 0.16959562285401963, 0.9880844798833297, 0.17091233021811894, 0.9472713660432762, 0.8836448942856019, 1.0, 0.997248255612149, 0.7663764505224382, 0.0011948616384413516, 0.2685593256367353, 0.9393805312218808, 0.4480917790585423, 0.8175627963736267, 0.9999752050825818, 0.9772111273260142, 1.0, 0.9194786692621277, 0.13293281428138834, 0.7965319709650703, 0.9317255058716325, 0.8175744308728488, 0.9999938011552557, 0.9998706746514326, 0.27402161931792574, 0.2444580808064356, 0.8695157493174842, 0.41033247146989615, 0.966532269772902, 0.3998449513475745, 0.3535549911670447, 0.10338435304155047, 0.47910783015911934, 0.3465389785470494, 0.9986429773724659, 0.9996673975237169, 0.9991534967409738, 0.9999661457096377, 0.9701281632693889, 0.9999830725678546, 0.5839013489734365, 0.893282230849387, 0.998818364882142, 0.999902734679677, 0.7566321365240437, 0.9997809413187714, 1.0, 0.9999997615814777, 0.8775071766526695, 0.39006323049307706, 0.9974396386643991, 0.19575646220519027, 0.9565391217238004, 0.6170520588957689, 0.24470465621660034, 0.9626549555519092, 0.5011684210770588, 0.2301015682261418, 0.48145013229745065, 0.7904934329463863, 0.9922015859644147, 0.5614703897293091, 0.7597178697702669, 0.9980426075843416, 0.9335317516745072, 0.9934505469232507, 0.39250631285719284, 0.47248163722622666, 0.6498489791418195, 0.7347736476689638, 0.9011725534416425, 0.9943185240652314, 0.8328041446208723, 0.9912954779530242, 0.9117408971682261, 0.9979019170541247, 0.9277786398193183, 0.5138811229729454, 0.6342717424263505, 0.7300513297422839, 0.9999586360869612, 0.39480139821632276, 0.5526827087368054, 0.43758282809940474, 0.9284998442573741]",0.663384013444871,Tissue,"['T', 'issue']",0.9999971985899396,0.95,"{1: '\n        The response ""Tissue"" is semantically equivalent to the reference answer ""tissue"".

The question might be asking for the simplest possible formula, which is why I chose silica as my guess, but there's still a chance they could be looking for the more specific SiO2.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' Sil', 'ica', ' (', 'Si', 'O', '2', ')', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '7', '5', '\n', '\n', 'I', ""'"", 'm', ' ', '7', '5', '%', ' confident', ' that', ' the', ' answer', ' is', ' sil', 'ica', ',', ' even', ' though', ' sil', 'ica', ' is', ' typically', ' written', ' as', ' Si', 'O', '2', ' (', 'one', ' sil', 'icon', ' atom', ' and', ' two', ' oxygen', ' atoms', ' in', ' a', ' ratio', ' of', ' ', '1', ':', '2', '),', ' not', ' Si', 'O', ' (', 'a', ' ', '1', ':', '1', ' ratio', ').', ' The', ' question', ' might', ' be', ' asking', ' for', ' the', ' simpl', 'est', ' possible', ' formula', ',', ' which', ' is', ' why', ' I', ' chose', ' sil', 'ica', ' as', ' my', ' guess', ',', ' but', ' there', ""'"", 's', ' still', ' a', ' chance', ' they', ' could', ' be', ' looking', ' for', ' the', ' more', ' specific', ' Si', 'O', '2', '.', '']","[0.9999990463265931, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9713487922998687, 0.9999388493741573, 0.8448712919632597, 0.9470861330780809, 1.0, 0.9994409826676495, 0.9706250992875765, 0.9831181509699026, 0.9999991655356624, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.025659905966100734, 0.8932679682883463, 0.9984928469495158, 0.9999988079084972, 0.7353840877882336, 0.9621259760266024, 0.9998729390465787, 0.2598808159829598, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8417222307182622, 0.9280624478267637, 0.9764606005726958, 0.9858279292995066, 0.9932952691818907, 0.060082566126774754, 1.0, 0.05788013932992431, 0.8330336449024683, 0.9998904586656581, 0.16436999370503755, 0.6224399632096821, 0.24881993875652825, 0.13568613470613372, 0.06716270960106525, 0.7454198772254657, 0.9995735318946571, 1.0, 0.9994439596094169, 0.5793019017301511, 0.9431702405557604, 0.9998924847781113, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9974244580742704, 0.9412057229062188, 0.9999719866022398, 0.9999918938339075, 0.9999997615814777, 0.8677016459884029, 0.7542536744365059, 0.6480772258614359, 0.980471814797317, 0.9999984502816872, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.07083498325611548, 0.2387076682298725, 0.26314549187975855, 0.9999940395710211, 0.7590349286894881, 0.06379185297083834, 0.9697190533829343, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999966621509202, 0.9998648349398722, 0.9181801831095656, 0.31068282447113343, 0.7982062361779655, 0.33563342197216745, 0.8365683496260495, 0.07937508376609355, 0.794681357712327, 0.7814631901579474, 0.6648086896066038, 0.998498789497875, 0.1126244698826506, 0.9066553166529748, 0.5648919199871801, 0.3044048079687814, 0.3088192889265405, 0.6154788344338759, 0.9975771144806763, 0.3283085277475716, 0.9039722945947429, 1.0, 0.04612048665919653, 0.0850961874397745, 0.7814150757017669, 0.3149319401670174, 0.8077961842150166, 0.38682349229126295, 0.37436039748634214, 1.0, 0.9413750346104276, 0.9368163815900199, 0.6258408568280855, 0.055163907236481555, 0.002394879415996928, 0.9860921474805696, 0.9435178787729641, 0.9998849762651661, 0.632225008539421, 0.34124916356571905, 0.6336438009735631, 0.9385244973866586, 1.0, 0.934898323327891, 0.1661781851001646, 0.8363775941647976]",0.5747473875608785,Silica (SiO2),"['Sil', 'ica', '(', 'Si', 'O', '2', ')']",0.9604544302861816,0.75,"{1: '\n        The response ""Silica (SiO2)"" is semantically equivalent to the reference answer ""quartz"".

Probability: 0.3

Explanation (even though not asked for): While most chemical reactions, including redox reactions, start with reactants and end with products, the wording of this question is unusual. It asks for the final state of the reaction, which could technically be considered reactants, since the reactants are what the products ultimately become after the reverse reaction occurs. However, this is likely not the answer the question intends, and the vast majority of chemical reactions are discussed in terms of the initial reactants and final products.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' end', ' with', ' a', ' react', 'ant', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '3', '\n', '\n', 'Ex', 'plan', 'ation', ' (', 'even', ' though', ' not', ' asked', ' for', '):', ' While', ' most', ' chemical', ' reactions', ',', ' including', ' red', 'ox', ' reactions', ',', ' start', ' with', ' react', 'ants', ' and', ' end', ' with', ' products', ',', ' the', ' word', 'ing', ' of', ' this', ' question', ' is', ' unusual', '.', ' It', ' asks', ' for', ' the', ' final', ' state', ' of', ' the', ' reaction', ',', ' which', ' could', ' technically', ' be', ' considered', ' react', 'ants', ',', ' since', ' the', ' react', 'ants', ' are', ' what', ' the', ' products', ' ultimately', ' become', ' after', ' the', ' reverse', ' reaction', ' occurs', '.', ' However', ',', ' this', ' is', ' likely', ' not', ' the', ' answer', ' the', ' question', ' int', 'ends', ',', ' and', ' the', ' vast', ' majority', ' of', ' chemical', ' reactions', ' are', ' discussed', ' in', ' terms', ' of', ' the', ' initial', ' react', 'ants', ' and', ' final', ' products', '.', '']","[0.9999991655356624, 1.0, 1.0, 0.28795611323658316, 1.0, 0.834491069900088, 0.8929915338979227, 1.0, 0.9959103913676822, 0.9999995231630692, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.24251128372087433, 0.4048960483346495, 0.9999995231630692, 0.18976162696006932, 0.9944358068250078, 1.0, 0.6739224479404079, 0.9660691078732044, 0.9999967813595916, 0.928990221897577, 0.9381818968952996, 0.9525548930807859, 0.998959433139616, 0.05099544797468481, 0.7186528912137647, 0.9995666237248108, 0.9999994039539004, 0.43179924190582014, 0.9998133530919079, 0.9999983310727032, 1.0, 0.9999963045256735, 1.0, 0.4734045364012611, 1.0, 0.9999229967324448, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9999933243243503, 0.9977273258124917, 0.9996379732967622, 0.999982953362409, 0.99998879445232, 0.8692260836555412, 0.019238085183995484, 1.0, 0.9999994039539004, 0.880795747519314, 0.9780130894269254, 0.7606642788120226, 0.7585023909548213, 0.5703038315407026, 0.9082312261448062, 0.8298565232693336, 0.9795176765089368, 0.8663908867857905, 0.9942256599652637, 0.9964475915185589, 0.9602834573260727, 0.9977269696943627, 0.43552831234787803, 0.9857536724067091, 0.8959989173063925, 0.45116472773733746, 0.5270999950355013, 0.9992851364546497, 0.39968737731321213, 0.16343086096857062, 0.9999991655356624, 0.909491749186958, 0.3732744989472072, 0.08371539609853294, 0.6012139721763753, 0.9999785427891018, 0.9943808752436846, 0.8973091885155533, 0.839655362551776, 0.9980147039313512, 0.22417293667520768, 0.43643076791998664, 0.04702646528907406, 0.9240246373245116, 0.16426417866767928, 0.9999982118638471, 0.49873750033484565, 0.9997959553400236, 0.9946715176050931, 1.0, 0.8995327533331969, 0.9716737332817694, 0.4258935139044798, 0.9970242386013772, 0.622457437702345, 0.6876197870323668, 0.9929961439062525, 0.9322340135113127, 0.7885274361735349, 0.9999411140801218, 0.9184607606918263, 0.388854246578624, 0.6873897953219128, 0.4931606940911339, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9186855760743188, 0.9829577930247086, 0.7446731306592747, 0.7265278356279579, 0.9961120247619583, 0.9964048641117762, 0.9999998807907248, 0.05433382134434501, 0.2146274084898541, 0.97196127398114, 0.999290374204881, 0.2850406786349406, 0.9901070823794954, 0.9998871215477863, 0.5545145713090155, 0.7334672830903399]",0.6922267964646607,end with a reactant,"['end', 'with', 'a', 'react', 'ant']",0.7350536993048349,0.3,"{0: '\n        The response and reference answer are not semantically equivalent.

What are fungus like protists?,'slime molds and water molds'," Guess: Fungus-like protists are likely to be saprophytic, absorbing nutrients from dead organic material.
Probability: 0.75

Explanation (even though not asked for): Fungus-like protists share some similarities with fungi, such as their feeding mode. However, they are not true fungi but rather single-celled organisms that belong to the kingdom Protista. The most well-known examples of fungus-like protists are water molds, downy mildews, and brown algae. Their saprophytic lifestyle involves secreting enzymes that break down organic material externally, and then absorbing the resulting nutrients. While this is similar to how true fungi feed, fungus-like protists lack the complex structures such as hyphae, which are typical of true fungi. My guess is based on the assumption that the question refers to these saprophytic, fungus-like protists. An exact probability would require more context or information on what the asker considers ""fungus-like protists"" to be.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' F', 'ung', 'us', '-', 'like', ' prot', 'ists', '
