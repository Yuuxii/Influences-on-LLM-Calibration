what temperature is a salt ice bath,"'A cooling bath, in laboratory chemistry (often but not always organic chemistry ) practice, is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures, typically between 13 °C and −196 °C.'"," Guess: -20°C to -15°C (1°C difference for convenience)
Probability: 0.75

Justification: A salt ice bath typically involves adding salt to lower the freezing point of water, making it colder than regular ice. According to multiple sources, a salt ice bath can reach temperatures as low as -21.2°C (which is the eutectic point of NaCl and water). Considering that adding salt and stirring might not be perfect, and the ideal eutectic point might not always be reached, I believe -20°C to -15°C is a reasonable range that covers the most likely temperatures for a salt ice bath. Given the temperature range and the fact that there's a high chance of reaching -20°C to -15°C in a salt ice bath, I estimate a 0.75 probability for my guess.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' -', '2', '0',
