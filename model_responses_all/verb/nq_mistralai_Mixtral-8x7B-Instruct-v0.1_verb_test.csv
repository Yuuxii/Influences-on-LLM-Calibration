how many dominoes do you need for mexican train,A double-twelve set," Guess: 91 dominoes
Probability: 0.95 \
(This answer is based on the standard set of double-six dominoes, which contains 28 pieces, and the Mexican Train dominoes game typically uses four sets of these dominoes, totaling 112 pieces. However, some sets of Mexican Train dominoes include only three sets of double-six dominoes, which would be 84 pieces. The guess of 91 dominoes is the average of these two possibilities, and I believe there is a 95% chance that the game uses one of these two sets.)","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' ', '9', '1', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '9', '5', ' \\', '\n', '(', 'This', ' answer', ' is', ' based', ' on', ' the', ' standard', ' set', ' of', ' double', '-', 'six', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ',', ' which', ' contains', ' ', '2', '8', ' pieces', ',', ' and', ' the', ' Mexican', ' Train', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ' game', ' typically', ' uses', ' four', ' sets', ' of', ' these', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ',', ' total', 'ing', ' ', '1', '1', '2', ' pieces', '.', ' However', ',', ' some', ' sets', ' of', ' Mexican', ' Train', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ' include', ' only', ' three', ' sets', ' of', ' double', '-', 'six', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ',', ' which', ' would', ' be', ' ', '8', '4', ' pieces', '.', ' The', ' guess', ' of', ' ', '9', '1', ' dom', 'ino', 'es', ' is', ' the', ' average', ' of', ' these', ' two', ' possibilities', ',', ' and', ' I', ' believe', ' there', ' is', ' a', ' ', '9', '5', '%', ' chance', ' that', ' the', ' game', ' uses', ' one', ' of', ' these', ' two', ' sets', '.)', '']","[0.9999979734461775, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 0.920903343751827, 1.0, 0.9995019533348468, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 0.998966570836947, 0.9999991655356624, 1.0, 0.9999971389852362, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8022079988988504, 0.9998934382484954, 0.9673751373740647, 0.955252052458185, 0.999337278211512, 0.9926983734563505, 0.6059656496739801, 0.9974947905445736, 0.9999440939703319, 1.0, 0.9993288256392862, 0.9955958640631952, 0.74926095840943, 0.9998511297681834, 0.20124556433540275, 0.999948861828418, 0.5415136266380689, 0.9999706753740273, 0.9999833109787883, 1.0, 0.9914135716805628, 0.9944433516573419, 0.8258716505653525, 1.0, 0.9998205030304158, 1.0, 0.8726625974445941, 0.992595241405754, 0.9999959469005546, 0.9104492411157561, 0.9634700421999974, 1.0, 0.2573330278173373, 0.9999971389852362, 0.8173200812236603, 0.7552541590982087, 0.7181676911245597, 0.8692954469425686, 0.9906149931822736, 0.9977509411650888, 0.7092614848066542, 0.992457843258224, 0.08999014928218627, 0.9984986705837913, 1.0, 0.8966214233123595, 0.11965773365329008, 1.0, 0.9999992847447459, 0.9989674036258953, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999650728993075, 0.9983803084587514, 0.9651729903917283, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9122404144853152, 0.648331721172947, 0.9885886858629956, 0.9997842777258222, 1.0, 0.9999415908602125, 0.9998415959451853, 1.0, 0.2477770910733394, 0.9320445683771286, 0.9995787726692741, 0.9995655517431101, 0.9919752559575771, 0.9698330701113113, 1.0, 0.9999984502816872, 0.9998834269057351, 0.9999957084838798, 1.0, 0.9790021135783822, 0.05745922702269542, 0.9961929377763369, 0.2639781579996689, 0.9953875884572583, 0.9999977350285647, 1.0, 0.9995654326438004, 0.980134323213391, 0.22026955921486074, 0.6682467160937403, 0.9873197226923718, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9806612831572795, 0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 0.9683493472949415, 0.28042396358529076, 0.9703683167845746, 0.9999221623902257, 0.9943626050576524, 0.9999866487378297, 0.37950481869153846, 0.7860298421980344, 0.6997992179734108, 0.8673076233997399, 0.7202166344146214, 0.8845285677562602, 0.9465856567357734, 0.9999979734461775, 0.9982582916433116, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999973774024795, 0.9967272453571165, 0.999736855150911, 0.6790384401364643, 0.99245514292414, 0.9199725761632723, 0.30910222458970976, 0.9999039265409296, 0.9999938011552557, 0.9967550772742764, 0.9764542366136298, 0.9233693120485962, 0.9999976158197796]",0.8377351486502519,91 dominoes,"['9', '1', 'dom', 'ino', 'es']",0.9835569896780972,0.95,"{0: '\n        The response and reference answer are not semantically equivalent.

Idris Elba is a famous actor, so there's a chance that he could play a character named Poppy in some production, but it's a guess with low confidence.)","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' I', 'dr', 'is', ' El', 'ba', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '2', '5', '\n', '\n', '(', 'Note', ':', ' I', ""'"", 'm', ' making', ' an', ' assumption', ' that', ' ""', 'the', ' beat', ' goes', ' on', '""', ' refers', ' to', ' a', ' movie', ' or', ' TV', ' show', ',', ' and', ' the', ' character', ' ""', 'Pop', 'py', '""', ' is', ' not', ' a', ' widely', ' known', ' character', ' with', ' a', ' single', ',', ' obvious', ' actor', '.', ' I', 'dr', 'is', ' El', 'ba', ' is', ' a', ' famous', ' actor', ',', ' so', ' there', ""'"", 's', ' a', ' chance', ' that', ' he', ' could', ' play', ' a', ' character', ' named', ' Pop', 'py', ' in', ' some', ' production', ',', ' but', ' it', ""'"", 's', ' a', ' guess', ' with', ' low', ' confidence', '.)', '']","[0.9999979734461775, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9138071518841748, 0.06902414999076424, 0.9999955892755636, 0.9999966621509202, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9994751586926784, 0.9999983310727032, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.11890518555133991, 0.8314269214380903, 0.9999102434642078, 1.0, 0.43558137681943443, 0.9879117944371818, 0.9999911785905904, 0.9049611530732719, 0.9831269059773048, 1.0, 0.6944880432817759, 0.6767653969392081, 0.9663539010493433, 0.6480896450151552, 0.995238317259554, 0.9982902484008493, 0.9999645960934689, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6503565153952261, 1.0, 0.7286545049398745, 0.813054770106575, 0.8843380641063644, 0.3230529364387645, 0.9997394763702845, 0.7244725318653105, 0.5080132733641537, 0.024488794047741298, 0.9432317513445188, 0.6591427631497889, 0.9996640619140269, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9164200884915584, 0.5366569737914635, 0.5809222656087696, 0.5684874040109714, 0.6003897201714895, 0.7892929658695729, 0.08929529037018047, 0.8755162175581922, 0.9889636215805677, 0.8656465833282435, 0.9051835071192477, 0.9998480312584628, 0.8392527280161715, 0.28508380187805743, 0.995492246956289, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 0.9991333849004659, 0.9976865054672728, 0.1125181602432384, 0.9857271464926092, 0.7467106550306422, 0.34385682427057784, 0.7260489815117344, 0.9890099106584429, 1.0, 0.9910934472136943, 0.23970874385828592, 0.13418349264420665, 0.9998586377723401, 0.9460554065139897, 0.5706920929472126, 0.5583220111031796, 0.6813253107947529, 0.9857113932246518, 0.9859354538874124, 1.0, 0.6507786207680075, 0.9282896203696331, 0.8864250381685472, 0.9677801470515006, 0.9908213926082089, 0.9411281114342578, 0.9997341147899056, 1.0, 0.5333740967941745, 0.27516032820922187, 0.5104253292266634, 0.8430239831669936, 0.9995936614971627, 0.9867274314347465, 1.0]",0.7217210075307452,Idris Elba,"['I', 'dr', 'is', 'El', 'ba', 'is', 'a']",0.8349512791988953,0.25,"{0: '\n        The response provided is not semantically equivalent to the reference answer.

whos jack the ripper in gotham by gaslight,Jacob Packer," Guess: Jonathan Crane (aka Scarecrow)
Probability: 0.7

Here's my answer with the requested format. I'm guessing the identity of Jack the Ripper in the animated movie ""Gotham by Gaslight"" is Jonathan Crane, who in the DC Comics universe is better known as Scarecrow. I've seen the movie and based on my knowledge of the film and the character, I believe there's a 70% chance this guess is correct. Please note that this is just an estimate, and there's always a chance I could be wrong.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', ' Jonathan', ' Cr', 'ane', ' (', 'aka', ' Sc', 'are', 'c', 'row', ')', '\n', 'Pro', 'b', 'ability', ':', ' ', '0', '.', '7', '\n', '\n', 'Here', ""'"", 's', ' my', ' answer', ' with', ' the', ' requested', ' format', '.', ' I', ""'"", 'm', ' guess', 'ing', ' the', ' identity', ' of', ' Jack', ' the', ' R', 'ipper', ' in', ' the', ' animated', ' movie', ' ""', 'G', 'oth', 'am', ' by', ' Gas', 'light', '""', ' is', ' Jonathan', ' Cr', 'ane', ',', ' who', ' in', ' the', ' DC', ' Com', 'ics', ' universe', ' is', ' better', ' known', ' as', ' Sc', 'are', 'c', 'row', '.', ' I', ""'"", 've', ' seen', ' the', ' movie', ' and', ' based', ' on', ' my', ' knowledge', ' of', ' the', ' film', ' and', ' the', ' character', ',', ' I', ' believe', ' there', ""'"", 's', ' a', ' ', '7', '0', '%', ' chance', ' this', ' guess', ' is', ' correct', '.', ' Please', ' note', ' that', ' this', ' is', ' just', ' an', ' estimate', ',', ' and', ' there', ""'"", 's', ' always', ' a', ' chance', ' I', ' could', ' be', ' wrong', '.', '']","[0.9999990463265931, 1.0, 1.0, 0.009861765394873436, 0.9997778432447929, 0.9999994039539004, 0.9142539257433253, 0.8725940707099108, 0.9999362271009363, 1.0, 0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 0.9932969158226429, 0.9995349425236921, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 0.9999896288992496, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9525415896840956, 0.33796719573056777, 0.9999991655356624, 0.00440161975126692, 0.9999744898630244, 1.0, 0.5721103082923744, 0.8722521806208721, 0.8443142238554154, 0.8661772617261826, 0.8137688052202403, 0.9999952316511553, 0.8140788558948093, 0.7434522310210353, 0.5596593460433108, 0.9626718573155658, 0.9533192648892984, 1.0, 0.07760625241825518, 0.20503710254541635, 1.0, 0.9941791165874001, 1.0, 1.0, 0.999993562740002, 0.9979635309816747, 0.9993476357943691, 0.838095036218448, 0.7310231096846072, 0.9959439711807229, 0.9999979734461775, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9980731256145194, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 0.9999539873315005, 0.9999988079084972, 0.9999727018181879, 0.9999988079084972, 1.0, 0.9842187942493162, 0.993764190554922, 0.30978178170943743, 0.9926928522239021, 0.9619794508110237, 0.8819613642821577, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9871026991478419, 0.9824626497474878, 0.5718297646470075, 0.9999991655356624, 0.9998205030304158, 0.37753810263943366, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9975824531409618, 0.8954682752765603, 0.45210292490035, 0.499243205944659, 0.876215538634272, 0.999447174672272, 0.998498789497875, 0.8669280284317349, 0.3973233422653758, 0.9924117001200802, 0.9806154286609156, 0.9013283511388137, 0.9994445549755643, 0.9951054989141165, 0.754327947094042, 0.987558465441134, 0.9840095949545886, 0.9566760261165814, 0.9997204131848384, 0.9999620928847356, 0.3390538769062942, 0.9996538169029469, 0.9914223599348597, 1.0, 0.9999945164027223, 0.9999917746265009, 0.9997040909250393, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9971137147900739, 0.1961983370628942, 0.7309960517418846, 1.0, 0.9999412332751231, 0.9999219240120591, 0.06420659563801506, 0.9921905546006154, 0.9991721812864935, 0.7207255139494692, 0.9028763609475824, 0.5945495468171953, 0.6484995913003349, 0.6490939111310994, 0.4370008572395192, 0.965600056359427, 0.17648416368099684, 0.893488600914829, 1.0, 0.9887090491969571, 0.9959854769063119, 0.9892172755834318, 0.9871907519271561, 0.9996891987939149, 1.0, 0.9686257519110255, 0.9887021735545679, 0.9996607262863729]",0.7712790906503029,Jonathan Crane (aka Scarecrow),"['Jonathan', 'Cr', 'ane', '(', 'aka', 'Sc', 'are', 'c', 'row', ')']",0.6155719604917392,0.7,"{0: '\n        The response provided is not semantically equivalent to the reference answer.

when was to god be the glory written,around 1872," Guess: 1779

(Note: The hymn ""To God Be the Glory"" was first published in 1875, but the lyrics were written by Fanny Crosby around 1844, while the tune was composed by William Howard Doane in 1872.

In fact, the Eagles last appearance in the Super Bowl before that was on January 29, 1981, over 40 years ago.

The actual singer of the song ""Always Be Humble and Kind"" is Miranda Lambert, but I think the most likely guesses, based on genre and style, would be Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Brandi Carlile, Kacey Musgraves, Chris Stapleton, Jewel, or Rascal Flatts. I believe Brandi Carlile or Kacey Musgraves are the most likely to have written or performed the song, but I'm not confident in those guesses, hence the low probabilities.","[' Gu', 'ess', ':', '

where was held the first session of muslim league,"Dhaka, Bangladesh"," Guess: Punjab, Pakistan

The Muslim League was a political party in the British Raj (which is now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), and it held its first session in Dhaka, which is now the capital of Bangladesh. However, it's worth noting that the Muslim League was particularly influential in what is now Pakistan, so there's a reasonable chance that the first session was held there instead.
