I’d ask for you to respect the rules of the sub and provide your answer as a *guess* only in the future.
User 0: I'm sorry, I understand. I joined this sub today so I didn't know. I thought I was being helpful, and it didn't seem too important since I wasn't trying to game the system, I just wanted to make sure people saw a correct answer. But I'll respect the guidelines in the future.
User 1: No worries, I understand where you’re coming from. This sub just has some strict requirements (which can definitely be confusing!)

Thanks for your understanding in the future!
User 0: This is very strange though. I didn't make a comment with an answer, just the guess as asked. I don't know where the information came from.
User 1: It could’ve been someone else trying to answer the question but got confused about how this sub works. I’ll double check.

Thanks for your understanding in the future

Which American was the youngest male Olympic gold medalist when he won in 1948?,'Bob Matthias'," Bob Mathias (17y 236d)
User 1: I’m a bit confused by this post.  Were you asking for the answer or making a statement?  The way I read it is as a statement, but I wanted to confirm since you also stated “the question is”.

In any case, I can answer.  Bob Mathias was indeed the youngest American to win an Olympic gold medal, at the age of 17 years and 236 days (when he won the decathlon in 1948).  That record held up for 52 years until it was broken by US swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2016.

If there was a question there, I guess my only question would be, was my guess the most correct?  Since I’m assuming a “best guess” would be seeking 100% accuracy.

User 1: I’m a bit confused by this post.  Were you asking for the answer or making a statement  The way I read it is as a statement, but I wanted to confirm since you also stated “the question is”.

In any case, I can answer.  Bob Mathias was indeed the youngest American to win an Olympic gold medal, at the age of 17 years and 236 days (when he won the decathlon in 1948).  That record held up for 52 years until it was broken by US swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2016.

If there was a question there, I guess my only question would be, was my guess the most correct  Since I’m assuming a “best guess” would be seeking 100% accuracy.

Despite their appearance, they are more closely related to crabs and shrimps than to mollusks like clams or oysters.","[' Cr', 'ust', 'ace', 'an', '.', ' Barn', 'acles', ' are', ' marine', ' organ', 'isms', ' with', ' a', ' sophisticated', ' life', ' cycle', ',', ' often', ' compared', ' to', ' that', ' of', ' cr', 'abs', ' and', ' sh', 'rim', 'ps', ',', ' making', ' them', ' cr', 'ust', 'ace', 'ans', '.', ' They', ' attach', ' themselves', ' to', ' hard', ' surfaces', ' in', ' the', ' ocean', ',', ' using', ' a', ' stalk', ' for', ' mobility', ' in', ' their', ' l', 'ar', 'val', ' stage', ' and', ' a', ' tough', ' outer', ' shell', ' for', ' protection', ' once', ' they', ' reach', ' ad', 'ul', 'th', 'ood', '.', ' Despite', ' their', ' appearance', ',', ' they', ' are', ' more', ' closely', ' related', ' to', ' cr', 'abs', ' and', ' sh', 'rim', 'ps', ' than', ' to', ' m', 'oll', 'us', 'ks', ' like', ' cl', 'ams', ' or', ' o', 'yst', 'ers', '.', '']","[0.9958201849943903, 0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9308323386882221, 0.9909130366421355, 0.9999952316511553, 0.9999967813595916, 0.5576041879626014, 0.8589314551618158, 1.0, 0.9988972202470193, 0.9999961853172863, 0.00024242165727034922, 0.1250540723904879, 0.9999990463265931, 0.8332148472164809, 0.1628408496913892, 0.0023211779064653544, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9457629393038919, 1.0, 0.9845102279505804, 0.9999870063564401, 0.9940845120153288, 0.9840930559729177, 1.0, 0.9995694822610255, 0.777132978110336, 0.828556459952071, 1.0, 0.7939309737012328, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999997615814777, 0.9999817613105537, 0.6985487061193408, 0.4553637883397646, 0.9999623312833918, 0.8344064796586266, 0.19224060146824445, 0.9979188928127019, 0.8028483939615142, 0.20253148319630598, 0.9949826286866422, 0.46743871955282223, 0.5900365563468164, 0.2015279366397424, 0.02026843152728757, 0.5919210614104271, 0.29401831256803, 0.5475612700512041, 0.9523511539560449, 0.9838679854975034, 1.0, 0.9999977350285647, 0.9504375061389554, 0.285437427265135, 0.3041484695060973, 0.14728673106390605, 0.3327710938425982, 0.9871926100222239, 0.9812939483961426, 0.9981257346857464, 0.25527669887882265, 0.9186361789071185, 0.37901208525383046, 0.9968047047584506, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9988985285922535, 0.41003265602046407, 0.9790742132786728, 0.25191073822660265, 0.9944467705368724, 0.48287095908831396, 0.9696857612928419, 0.1607133800589086, 0.9995235092011517, 0.9999912977979261, 0.9999997615814777, 0.12660843900696184, 0.998072531762474, 0.8649824938199966, 0.8666185886130989, 1.0, 0.9875683480484501, 0.9998955835638214, 0.9372620726845187, 0.9420295189226214, 0.9995694822610255, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9999339624169534, 0.44788670586153434, 0.9545016305271984, 1.0, 0.9256221375480058, 0.9323154482748192, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9958683007520458, 0.9999897481064004]",0.6130045298486152,"Crustacean.
