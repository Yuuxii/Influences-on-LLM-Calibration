north carolina delegate to the second continental congress,Timothy Bloodworth," Joseph Hewes (first NC delegate, served 1774-1776) or William Hooper (also one of the first NC delegates, served 1774-1776) are possible guesses. Another could be John Penn (third NC delegate, served 1775-1776). There were only three NC delegates to the Second Continental Congress.

The exact answer cannot be given without additional context, as different historical events might be referring to different time periods during the two years of the Second Continental Congress (1775-1776). For example, Joseph Hewes is sometimes considered the most notable NC delegate as he served for the entire duration of the Congress and played a significant role in the naval affairs of the newly formed United States. However, William Hooper was the first to sign the Declaration of Independence on behalf of North Carolina, and John Penn signed it later in August 1776.","[' Joseph', ' He', 'w', 'es', ' (', 'first',

This is often attributed to issues such as jury bias, lack of proper understanding of the law, and the difficulty in selecting impartial and legally knowledgeable jurors.","['J', 'ury', 'system', 'not', 'abol', 'ished', ',', 'but', 'rarely', 'used', 'since', '1', '9', '6', '0', 's', '.', 'Off', 'ic', 'ially', ',', 'the', 'jury', 'system', 'in', 'India', 'was', 'not', 'abol', 'ished', 'but', 'it', 'has', 'been', 'largely', 'unused', 'since', 'the', '1', '9', '6', '0', 's', '.', 'In', '1', '9', '6', '0', ',', 'the', 'Indian', 'government', 'decided', 'to', 'restrict', 'the', 'use', 'of', 'j', 'uries', 'to', 'just', 'one', 'session', 'court', 'in', 'Delhi', ',', 'and', 'since', 'then', ',', 'it', 'has', 'rarely', 'been', 'used', '.', 'This', 'is', 'often', 'attributed', 'to', 'issues', 'such', 'as', 'jury', 'bias', ',', 'lack', 'of', 'proper', 'understanding', 'of', 'the', 'law', ',', 'and', 'the', 'difficulty', 'in', 'selecting', 'im', 'partial', 'and', 'legally', 'knowledge', 'able', 'jur', 'ors', '.']",0.6465030941694793,"{0: '\n        The response correctly states that the jury system in India is not officially abolished but is rarely used since the 1960s.

(Note: The First Battle of Ypres was a series of engagements that took place in October-November 1914, during World War I, but the fighting around the Ypres Salient continued throughout the war, with several other battles taking place in the same area. The next major engagement, often referred to as the Second Battle of Ypres, occurred from April to May 1915. However, the specific question asks for the end date of the ""first"" battle, so I am assuming that the focus is on the initial period of fighting in the fall of 1914. Therefore, my best guess is that the First Battle of Ypres ended in May 1915, although technically, the front lines had stabilized by November 1914, and the fighting around Ypres continued in various

(Note: The First Battle of Ypres was a series of engagements that took place in October-November 1914, during World War I, but the fighting around the Ypres Salient continued throughout the war, with several other battles taking place in the same area. The next major engagement, often referred to as the Second Battle of Ypres, occurred from April to May 1915. However, the specific question asks for the end date of the ""first"" battle, so I am assuming that the focus is on the initial period of fighting in the fall of 1914.

when was the last wolf pack killed in yellowstone,1926," 1926.

But please note that this is just a guess based on the pattern of the show's previous seasons, and it may be subject to change depending on the network's scheduling decisions.","[' A', ' quick', ' internet', ' search', ' shows', ' that', ' the', ' season', ' finale', ' of', ' Design', 'ated', ' Sur', 'viv', 'or', ' is', ' different', ' for', ' each', ' season', ',', ' as', ' the', ' show', ' has', ' been', ' broadcast', ' on', ' different', ' networks', '.', ' ', '\n', '\n', 'For', ' season', ' ', '1', ',', ' the', ' finale', ' a', 'ired', ' on', ' May', ' ', '1', '1', ',', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '7', '.', ' ', '\n', 'For', ' season', ' ', '2', ',', ' the', ' finale', ' a', 'ired', ' on', ' May', ' ', '1', '6', ',', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '8', '.', '\n', 'For', ' season', ' ', '3', ',', ' the', ' finale', ' (', 'and', ' series', ' finale', ')', ' a', 'ired', ' on', ' June', ' ', '7', ',', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '9', '.', '\n', '\n', 'There', 'fore', ',', ' my', ' best', ' guess', ' is', ' that', ' the', ' season', ' finale', ' of', ' Design', 'ated', ' Sur', 'viv', 'or', ' would', ' be', ' in', ' May', ',', ' if', ' the', ' show', ' were', ' to', ' have', ' another', ' season', '.', ' But', ' please', ' note', ' that', ' this', ' is', ' just', ' a', ' guess', ' based', ' on', ' the', ' pattern', ' of', ' the', ' show', ""'"", 's', ' previous', ' seasons', ',', ' and', ' it', ' may', ' be', ' subject', ' to', ' change', ' depending', ' on', ' the', ' network', ""'"", 's', ' schedul', 'ing', ' decisions', '.', '']","[0.7119806511061523, 0.9724149984231625, 0.6685363274387609, 0.9999998807907248, 0.8283859359417578, 0.9996183183805296, 0.9999979734461775, 0.03371633327920295, 0.9998592336474077, 0.9998201455395507, 0.9237205086365086, 1.0, 0.9999997615814777, 1.0, 1.0, 0.2461874034352799, 0.9992147894195977, 1.0, 0.9998754418066063, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9833116399771843, 0.29356249423282677, 0.9902867329010108, 0.9999889136593714, 0.9932862127065478, 0.24485910740295133, 0.1476730199418648, 0.999664657556759, 0.9995111233826437, 0.9999998807907248, 0.8840275342756116, 0.6443150806179487, 0.9998613788093218, 0.9975085499017181, 0.9561146883721583, 0.07456398167416377, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999151301890851, 0.9500312744208215, 0.9999781851762466, 0.9990851910605629, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999885560391694, 1.0, 0.9206497588883739, 0.6834272385290631, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9947799187523881, 0.9961574479240837, 0.6547574189533691, 0.9999990463265931, 0.9667641842887646, 0.9999947548186583, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 0.999769264069065, 0.9961117881980744, 0.9999992847447459, 0.9991709911698547, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999996423722521, 1.0, 0.9775515071111126, 0.9998116847948291, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9820097336540785, 0.9970761445706484, 0.49994361623308353, 0.9404323870173489, 0.999960304883893, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9840935178930977, 0.9576723077315418, 0.9996307068365735, 0.0040511857200955965, 0.6566238471243666, 0.9879790460846596, 0.9999905825550351, 0.9958161659853818, 0.9998855721777559, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9990868569532386, 1.0, 0.9997403104145877, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999996423722521, 0.9974939602606281, 0.9577229298502156, 0.9998379016459485, 0.6076780526529115, 0.9571803504839321, 0.9999867679437159, 0.7693453074243657, 0.9740124275816963, 0.9999871255623689, 0.3471910190948636, 0.9741328860202192, 0.938277916446359, 0.9706481217429218, 0.9990723401812425, 0.9971466651442525, 0.9906371031091781, 1.0, 0.9999998807907248, 0.9999984502816872, 1.0, 0.3976313790925164, 0.04691673849148571, 0.6652487595580724, 0.9663772757996792, 0.1955595588827786, 0.27484276185367335, 0.8642782674846579, 0.999989509692113, 0.9926452777055854, 0.9999504113947393, 0.4042052082879745, 0.965453027241288, 0.9999994039539004, 0.972575429881659, 0.05129655743097209, 0.05948747241264899, 0.40779189896811424, 0.945399685371849, 0.9962875894403999, 0.9975723692869246, 0.8995276463922398, 0.9693501624120523, 0.9995873485812237, 0.09334546040521352, 0.9999951124428961, 0.6457088716126549, 0.3197085199558139, 0.892265474567733, 0.9598263756203033, 0.005682002014083995, 0.9997905931366742, 1.0, 0.9182023960255604, 0.9448753406659053, 0.805486971418199, 0.9999288371183694, 0.1322946463357415, 0.5019285215007661, 0.8876786890934828, 0.8807821502491974, 0.9999986886995842, 0.9999742514560126, 0.7656995039830569, 0.9999997615814777, 0.9230651102013365, 0.36879411252760386, 0.9967082969002089, 1.0, 0.6211184080938447, 1.0, 0.8948437430206383, 0.9991201757390235, 0.996063057467726]",0.7384409751137744,"A quick internet search shows that the season finale of Designated Survivor is different for each season, as the show has been broadcast on different networks.
